All [API documentation](/reference/api/) is available on-line.

This is automatically generated from each back-end module's source RAML files (and JSON Schemas), and from the shared RAML repository.
This happens during continuous integration whenever that module's sources are merged to its master branch.

Each back-end module also enables local access and interaction with its API documentation.
